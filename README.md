# Modern Analytical Engine (MAE)

## What
MAE is the culmination of a lifelong dream to enable all students, young and old, near and far, to better understand the fundamental concepts of computing. As a young child I learned much in my grandfather's basement workshop, where we'd spend endless hours together as he tinkered with woods and metals, transforming raw materials into works of art and moving magic. As I grew the magic slowly faded as understanding, wonder and persistent curiosity emerged. Visible mechanisms enabled an instinctive understanding of how things worked in a manner that would never be possible with hidden electronics. MAE will be a full-sized, Modern Analytical Engine, demonstrating visibly, clearly, and mechanically in an approachable and accessible manner the inner workings of today's computers.

Project-MAE is an open source project and all are welcome and encouraged to participate. Preference is given to current high-school and university students and non-profit organizations.
